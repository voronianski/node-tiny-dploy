> Simple shell script + PM2 node.js deployer

This CLI will be helpful if you host the server with multiple applications and use `bash` scripts in order to redeploy them. Instead of supporting multiple files:

```bash
user@server:~$ ls -a
app1-prod-restart.sh
app1-staging-restart.sh
app2-prod-restart.sh
app2-staging-restart.sh
...
```

Just use one configuration file and several commands with `dploy`.

## Install

```bash
npm install tiny-dploy -g
```

## Commands

### ``dploy setup``

Creates new application instance. It will automatically clone repository into `/var/www`, install `npm` and `bower` dependencies, build application with `grunt build` and start application with `pm2`. Command will prompt you with available configuration options.

```bash
user@server:~$ dploy setup
name: staging
git url: git@bitbucket.org:user/test-app.git
git branch (master): rc_0 # defaults to `master`
node (app.js): app.coffee # defaults to `app.js`
folder in /var/www/ : test-app-dir # will look at `name` if not specified
pm2 process: test-app # will look at folder or `name` if not specified
pm2 opts: -i 4 # pm2 options
NODE_ENV (development): staging
NODE_PORT (80): 8081

-----> Clone git repo into folder with name "test-app"
...
```

### ``dploy list``

Lists instances created with `dploy setup`.

```bash
user@server:~$ dploy list
staging
production
```

### ``dploy reload [app]``

Reloads application instance without stopping it. Command fetches latest changes on specified `branch`, installs missed dependencies, builds it and restarts app silently with `pm2`.

### ``dploy restart [app]``

Stops running `pm2` app and performs the same actions as `dploy reload` then.

### ``dploy remove [app]``

Stops running `pm2` instance if it runs and deletes application folder from `/var/www/` as well as config entry.

## Requirements

You need these tools to be installed on your machine in order to work with `dploy`:

- [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [bower](http://bower.io)
- [grunt](http://gruntjs.com)
- [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2)

## Configuration

All configuration options are stored inside `.dploy_config.json` file which is located in your systems `HOME_DIR`. For [`dploy setup` example](https://github.com/voronianski/node-tiny-dploy#dploy-setup) generated json file will be as follows:

```json
{
  "staging": {
      "git": "git@bitbucket.org:user/test-app.git",
      "branch": "rc_0",
      "node": "app.coffee",
      "folder": "test-app-dir",
      "pm2": "test-app",
      "pm2 opts": "-i 4",
      "node_env": "staging",
      "port": "8081"
   }
}
```

You're free to make changes inside in order to update necessary application. There should be added special commands for that in the future.

## To Do

- [ ] Support for [gulp](http://gulpjs.com).

- [x] Command `dploy remove [app]` for removing apps from config and all necessary data.

- [ ] Command for editing app options `dploy set [app] branch:production`.

- [ ] Prettify outputs with colors.

- [ ] Add ascii table for list.

## Projects

List of the projects using this small and helpful hack :sunglasses: :
